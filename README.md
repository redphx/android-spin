# Spin
A simple app to fix the Gesture Pill not going away in fullscreen mode on the Logitech G Cloud.  
- Only apply to Tablet mode.
- No root needed.
- It can't be run directly, instead you need to activate it using a Tile in the Notification bar.

### How to use
1. [Download the APK](https://github.com/redphx/android-spin/releases/) and install it.
2. Fully expand the notification bar, click on the Edit button on the bottom-left to edit the tiles.
3. Drag the Spin tile (spiral icon) to the first area. Save it.

Now everytime you run into this bug, just activate the Spin tile, the screen will rotate for a few seconds and the pill will be gone.
